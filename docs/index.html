<p>
<b>polyparse</b> is a collection of parser combinator libraries in
Haskell.  It is distributed as a package, but you are likely to use only
one of the included variations at any one time - they are generally
alternatives to each other, as well as an alternative to other
widely-used parser libraries available elsewhere.

Parser combinators have a long history in Haskell.  The first(?) monadic
set of combinators was introduced by Hutton and Meijer in 1996, and
distributed with Gofer (a precursor to Hugs), and known simply as
ParseLib.  That set lives on here as Text.ParserCombinator.HuttonMeijer.

<center><h3><a name="install">Installation</a></h3></center>
<p>
To install polyparse, you must have a Haskell compiler: <em>ghc-6.2</em>
or later, and/or <em>nhc98-1.16/hmake-3.06</em> or later, and/or
<em>Hugs98 (Sept 2003)</em> or later.  For more recent compilers,
use the standard Cabal method of installation:
<pre>
    runhaskell Setup.hs configure [--prefix=...] [--buildwith=...]
    runhaskell Setup.hs build
    runhaskell Setup.hs install
</pre>

For older compilers, use:
<pre>
    ./configure [--prefix=...] [--buildwith=...]
    make
    make install
</pre>
to configure, build, and install polyparse as a package for your
compiler(s).  If you don't use the --prefix option, you may need write
permission on the library installation directories of your compiler(s).
Afterwards, to gain access to the polyparse libraries, you only need to
add the option <tt>-package polyparse</tt> to your compiler commandline
(no option required for Hugs).

<p>
Version 1.00 is the first release of polyparse as a separate package.
It was previously part of the HaXml suite.  HaXml continues to use
polyparse, but polyparse will be useful more widely.  If you are looking
for examples of the usage of polyparse, the implementations of
Text.XML.HaXml.Parse and Text.XML.HaXml.XmlContent are two good places
to look.
