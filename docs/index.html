<p>
<b>polyparse</b> is a collection of parser combinator libraries in
Haskell.  It is distributed as a package, but you are likely to use only
one of the included modules at any one time - they are generally
alternatives to each other, as well as an alternative to other
widely-used parser libraries available elsewhere.

<ul>
<li> <b>Text.ParserCombinators.HuttonMeijer</b>  The most venerable of all
     monadic parser combinator libraries, this version dates from 1996.
     Originally distributed with Gofer, then Hugs, as ParseLib.  It uses
     the idea of "failure as a list of successes" to give multiple
     possible parses through backtracking.  (But in practice, almost
     nobody wants any parse except the first complete one.)
<li> <b>Text.ParserCombinators.HuttonMeijerWallace</b>  The
     Hutton/Meijer combinators, extended to take an arbitrary token type
     as input (not just characters), plus a running state (e.g. to
     collect a symbol table, or macros), plus some facilities for
     simple error-reporting.
<li> <b>Text.ParserCombinators.Poly</b>
     The name Poly comes from the arbitrary token type.  Thus, you can
     write your own lexer if you wish, rather than needing to encode
     lexical analysis within the parser itself.  This is a fresh
     set of combinators, improving on the HuttonMeijer variety by
     keeping only a single success, not a list of them.  This is
     more space-efficient, whilst still permitting backtracking.
     Error-handling is also much improved: there are essentially two
     kinds of failure, soft and hard.  Soft failure just means that the
     current parse did not work out, but another parse might be OK.
     Hard failure means that no parse will succeed, because we have
     already passed a point of commitment.  Thus you can give far more
     accurate error messages to the user, including multi-layered
     locations.
<li> <b>Text.ParserCombinators.PolyState</b>  is just like Poly, except it
     adds an arbitrary running state parameter.
<li> <b>Text.ParserCombinators.PolyLazy</b>  is just like Poly, except it
     does not return explicit failures.  Instead, an exception is raised.
     Thus, it can return a partial parse result, before a full parse is
     complete.  The word partial indicates that, having committed to
     return some outer data constructor, we might later discover some
     parse error further inside, so the value will be partial, as in
     incomplete: containing bottom.  However, if you are confident that
     the input is error-free, then you will gain hugely in
     space-efficiency - essentially you can stream-process your parsed
     data-structure within very small constant space.  This is especially
     useful for large structures like e.g. XML trees.
<li> <b>Text.ParserCombinators.PolyStateLazy</b>  combines PolyState and
     PolyLazy.
<li> <b>Text.Parse</b>  The Text.Read class from Haskell'98 is widely
     recognised to have many problems.  It is inefficient.  If a read
     fails, there is no indication of why.  Worst of all, a read failure
     crashes your whole program!  Text.Parse is a proposed replacement
     for the Read class.  It defines a new class, Parse, with methods
     that return an explicit notification of errors, through the Either
     type.  It also defines a number of useful helper functions to
     enable the construction of parsers for textual representations of
     Haskell data structures, e.g. named fields.  Unsurprisingly,
     Text.Parse is really just a specialisation of the Poly combinators
     for String input, and the entire Poly API is also re-exported.
     The <a href="http://repetae.net/~john/computer/haskell/DrIFT">DrIFT</a>
     tool can derive instances of the Parse class for you
     automatically.  (Use the syntax <tt>{-! derive : Parse !-}</tt>)
</ul>
<p>
All the <b>Poly*</b> variations share the same basic API, so it is easy
to switch from one set to another, when you discover you need an extra
facility, just by changing a single import.

<p>
In general, you can just add an import of the relevant module to your
source code, and everything should just compile OK.  However, if the
package is not 'exposed' (in ghc-pkg terminology), then you might need
to use a command-line option <tt>--package polyparse</tt> at compile
time.

<center><h3><a name="install">Installation</a></h3></center>
<p>
To install polyparse, you must have a Haskell compiler: <em>ghc-6.2</em>
or later, and/or <em>nhc98-1.16/hmake-3.06</em> or later, and/or
<em>Hugs98 (Sept 2003)</em> or later.  For more recent compilers,
use the standard Cabal method of installation:
<pre>
    runhaskell Setup.hs configure [--prefix=...] [--buildwith=...]
    runhaskell Setup.hs build
    runhaskell Setup.hs install
</pre>

For older compilers, use:
<pre>
    ./configure [--prefix=...] [--buildwith=...]
    make
    make install
</pre>
to configure, build, and install polyparse as a package for your
compiler(s).  If you don't use the --prefix option, you may need write
permission on the library installation directories of your compiler(s).
Afterwards, to gain access to the polyparse libraries, you only need to
add the option <tt>-package polyparse</tt> to your compiler commandline
(no option required for Hugs).

<p>
Version 1.00 is the first release of polyparse as a separate package.
It was previously part of the HaXml suite.  HaXml continues to use
polyparse, but polyparse will be useful more widely.  If you are looking
for examples of the usage of polyparse, the implementations of
Text.XML.HaXml.Parse and Text.XML.HaXml.XmlContent are two good places
to look.

Parser combinators have a long history in Haskell.  The first(?) monadic
set of combinators was introduced by Hutton and Meijer in 1994, and
distributed with Gofer (a precursor to Hugs), and known simply as
ParseLib.  That set lives on here as Text.ParserCombinator.HuttonMeijer.
