<h3>Changes in polyparse-1.00</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>No changes, but released separately from HaXml
</ul>

<h3>Changes in HaXml-1.16</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> New: lazier parsers
     <ul>
     <li> <tt>Text.XML.HaXml.ParseLazy</tt>
     <li> <tt>Text.XML.HaXml.Html.ParseLazy</tt>
     <li> <tt>Text.ParserCombinators.PolyLazy</tt>
     <li> <tt>Text.ParserCombinators.PolyStateLazy</tt>
     </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Changes in HaXml-1.15</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> New: DrIFT has now been fully updated to
     produce instances of Text.ParserCombinators.TextParser.Parse.
<li> New: the parser combinator library Poly has been split into two
     variations, Poly and PolyState.  They have almost the same API,
     only the latter includes a running state where the former does not.
<li> The TextParser library (a replacement for the Haskell'98 Read class)
     has also been improved with more new combinators.  Really, these
     parser combinator experiments do not belong in HaXml, and will
     eventually be split out into a separate package.
</ul>
